# clinical_ner_project-
Clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) with the dataset BC5CDR on HuggingFace, the pretrained model extracts medications, dosages, conditions and procedures from clinical notes

 ## What we covered:
 1. ✅ Using pre-trained biomedical NER models (zero training)
 2. ✅ Loading and exploring the BC5CDR clinical dataset
 3. ✅ Setting up fine-tuning with BioBERT
 4. ✅ Building a complete extraction pipeline
 5. ✅ Exporting structured results
